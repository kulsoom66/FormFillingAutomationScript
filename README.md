Check it out at a glance in the following simple example!
1. Open Browser: WebDriver starts a web browser like Chrome.
2. Visit Website: WebDriver goes to a specific website, like www.ca-oman.com.
3. Click Button: WebDriver looks for a Contact Us button on the webpage, then clicks on it.
4. Fill Forms: Webdriver finds places to enter information (like your name and email), and types in the details.
5. Submit Form: WebDriver locates the button to submit the form and clicks it.

So, WebDriver acts like a virtual user, following these steps to interact with websites automatically.
